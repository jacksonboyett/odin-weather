First, work on getting the data. Once you get the data, then stylize it. 

1. Create functions that take a locaation and return the weather data for that location
	and use console.log to display information
2. Write functions that process the JSON data from the API and return an object with
	only the data you need
3. Set up a form that lets users input their location and that will fetch the weather data
4. Display information and add styling
